-    5. Use of class attributes
- CSS:
-    1. Selectors (e.g. Type, Chaining, Class, Grouping, etc.)
-    2. Basic CSS properties (e.g. color, background-color, etc.)
-    3. Proper knowledge of specificity, inheritance, and rule order
-    4. Linking external CSS stylesheet to index.html
-    5. Proper knowledge of the box model (e.g. margins, paddings)
